ng-flow with Java
========

Project based on https://github.com/flowjs/flow.js/tree/master/samples/java, updated everything to work wiht flow and ng-flow, instead of resumable.
It should be able to work with cors.

I am using wildfly, but with some minor modifications on the pom you can probably use it on glassfish or any other server.
